This proyect is a complete (WIP) packet sniffer tool composed by a [console UI] + [Engine]

  - The UI just provides the user some interaction to adjust and filter the interrested packets
  - The Engine just conects to the sockets and packets:
  
      -The engine just provides all the packets and their info but is adjusted to the user necesities.
      -The raw engine would simply just retrieve all the package data without any kind of filter and has no prints, its simply the code you need to copy/paste
       on your proyect. This code its not directly accesible by the main aplication workflow so if you just want the tool you can delete it.
